\section{Consistent Lifetimes (34 points)}

Suppose that you are an historian, and you are trying to figure out possible dates for when various historical figures may have lived.  In particular, there are $n$ people $P_1, P_2, \dots, P_n$ who you are studying.  Based on your research, you have discovered a collection of $m$ facts about when these people lived relative to each other.  Each of these facts has one of the following two forms:
\begin{itemize}
\item For some $i$ and $j$, person $P_i$ died before person $P_j$ was born; or
\item For some $i$ and $j$, the lifetimes of $P_i$ and $P_j$ overlapped.
\end{itemize}

Unfortunately, since the historical record is never fully trustworthy, it's possible that some of these facts are incorrect.  Design an $O(n+m)$ time algorithm to at least check whether they are \emph{internally consistent}, i.e., whether there is a birth and a death date for each person so that all of the facts are true.  As always, prove running time and correctness (i.e., prove that if there is a possible set of dates then your algorithm will return yes, and if no such dates are possible then your algorithm will return no).

\section{Minimum Spanning Trees (33 points)}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Suppose that we are given a connected graph $G = (V, E)$ where all edge weights are distinct.  Prove that there is a \emph{unique} minimum spanning tree.  
\end{enumerate}

As in the previous part, suppose that we are given a connected graph $G = (V, E)$ where all edge weights are distinct.  But instead of trying to construct an MST, we are trying to construct a something else.  Given a spanning tree $T = (V, E')$ of $G$, the \emph{bottleneck edge} of $T$ is the edge in $E'$ of maximum weight.  A spanning tree $T$ is a \emph{minimum-bottleneck spanning tree} if there is no spanning tree $T'$ of $G$ with a lower weight bottleneck edge.

\begin{enumerate}[(a), resume]
\item Is every minimum-bottleneck spanning tree of $G$ also a minimum spanning tree of $G$?  Prove or give a counterexample (and explanation).
\item Is every minimum spanning tree of $G$ a minimum-bottleneck spanning tree of $G$?  Prove or give a counterexample (and explanation).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Shortest Paths (33 points)}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item We saw in class that Dijkstra's algorithm for computing shortest paths in a directed graph does not work if there are negative edge lengths.  Consider the following idea to fix this.
\begin{quote}
First add a large enough positive constant to every edge weight so that the ``revised" edge lengths are all positive (for example, you could add the value $1 + \max_{v \in V} |len(v)|$).  To find the shortest path between two nodes $s$ and $t$ in the original graph, run Dijkstra's algorithm using the revised edge lengths to find the shortest path between $s$ and $t$ using the revised lengths, and return the path which it finds.
\end{quote}
Does this work?  That is, will this always return the shortest path under the original edge lengths?  If so, give a proof.  If not, give a counterexample (and explain it). 

\item Now suppose that instead of adding the same value to every length, we instead \emph{multiply} every length by the same value $\alpha > 0$ (note that this preserves the sign of each edge length).  Let $P$ be a shortest path from $s$ to $t$ under the original edge lengths.  Is $P$ still a shortest path from $s$ to $t$ under the new edge lengths?  If yes, give a proof.  If no, give a counterexample (and explain it).  

\end{enumerate}
