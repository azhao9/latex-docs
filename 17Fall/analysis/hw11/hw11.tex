\section*{Chapter 11: The Space of Continuous Functions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item[1.] For each $n,$ let $Q_n$ be the set of all polygonal functions that have nodes at $k/n, k=0, \cdots, n.,$ and that take on only rational values at those points. Check that $Q_n$ is a countable set, and hence tha the union of the $Q_n$'s is a countable dense set in $C[0, 1].$

	\item[7.] If $p$ is a polynomial and $\varepsilon>0,$ prove that there is a polynomial $q$ with rational coefficients such that $\left\lVert p-q \right\rVert_\infty<\varepsilon$ on $[0, 1].$

	\item[9.] Let $\mathcal P_n$ denote the set of polynomials of degree at most $n,$ considered as a subset of $C[a, b]).$ Clearly $\mathcal P_n$ is a subspace of $C[a, b]$ of dimension $n+1.$ Also, $\mathcal P_n$ is closed in $C[a, b].$ How do you know that $\mathcal P,$ the union of all of the $P_n,$ is not all of $C[a, b]?$ That is, why are there necessarily non-polynomial elements in $C[a, b]?$

	\item[12.] Let $p_n$ be a polynomial of degree $m_n,$ and suppose that $p_n\Rightarrow f$ on $[a, b],$ where $f$ is not a polynomial. Show that $m_n\to \infty.$

	\item[14.] Let $f\in C[a, b]$ be continuously differentiable, and let $\varepsilon>0.$ Show that there is a polynomial $p$ such that $\left\lVert f-p \right\rVert_\infty<\varepsilon$ and $\left\lVert f'-p' \right\rVert_\infty<\varepsilon.$ Conclude that $C^{(1)}[a, b]$ is separable.

	\item[27.] Let $T$ be a trig polynomial. Prove:
		\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
			\item If $T$ is an odd function, then $T$ can be written using only cosines.

			\item If $T$ is an even function, then $T$ can be written using only sines.
				
		\end{enumerate}
		
\end{itemize}
