\section*{Chapter 9: Category}

\begin{itemize}
	\item[5.] If $A$ is a subset of $\RR$ and if $x$ is in the interior of $A,$ show that $x$ is a point of continuity for $\chi_A$ (the characteristic function of $A$). Are there any other points of continuity?

	\item[9.] If $E$ is a closed set in $\RR,$ show that $E=D(f)$ for some bounded function $f.$ (Hint: A sum of two characteristic functions will do the trick.)

	\item[12.] More generally, in any metric space, show that every open set is an $F_\sigma$ and that every close set is a $G_\delta.$

	\item[14.] Prove that $A$ has an empty interior in $M$ if and only if $A^c$ is dense in $M.$

	\item[28.] In a metric space $M,$ show that any subset of a first category set is still first category, and that a countable union of first category sets is again first category.
		
	\item[30.] Show that $\NN$ is first category in $\RR$ but second category in itself.

	\item[32.] In $\RR,$ show that any open interval (and hence any nonempty, open set) is a second category set.

	\item[47.] Let $\mathcal P$ be the vector space of all polynomials supplied with the norm $\left\lVert p \right\rVert = \max_{0\le i\le n} \abs{a_i},$ where $p(x)=a_0+a_1x+\cdots+a_n x^n\in\mathcal P.$ Show that $P$ is not complete.
		
\end{itemize}
