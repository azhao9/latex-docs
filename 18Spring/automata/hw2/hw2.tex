\begin{enumerate}
	\item Give the state diagram of a DFA recognizing the following language. The alphabet is $\left\{ 0, 1 \right\}.$
		\begin{align*}
			\left\{ w:w\text{ has length exactly 3 and its last symbol is different from its first symbol} \right\}
		\end{align*}

	\item Give a DFA (both a state diagram and a formal description) recognizing the following language. The alphabet is $\left\{ 0, 1 \right\}.$
		\begin{align*}
			\left\{ w:w\text{ has odd length or contains an even number of 0s} \right\}
		\end{align*}

	\item Show that the following language is regular, where the alphabet is $\left\{ 0, 1 \right\}.$
		\begin{align*}
			\left\{ w:w\text{ contains an equal number of occurrences of the substrings 01 and 10} \right\}
		\end{align*}

	\item For any string $w=w_1w_2\cdots w_n,$ the reverse of $w,$ written as $w^{\mathcal R},$ is the string $w$ in reverse order $w_n\cdots w_2 w_1.$ For any language $A,$ let $A^{\mathcal R}=\left\{ w^{\mathcal R}:w\in A \right\}.$ Show that if $A$ is regular, so is $A^{\mathcal R}.$
